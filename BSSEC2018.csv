To this end, the design approach, which is fostered by the increasing complexity of current constructions, has involved the development of new skills that allow for the management and sharing of a large amount of digitalized information (digitalization) through an easy and coordinated procedure (interoperability). The result of such a design process will be technologically advanced and sustainable constructions (construction 4.0). Indeed, the new design approach meets a growing demand for the evaluation of sustainability in construction interventions. Lifecycle-based methodologies are the fundamental operational tools in this regard, with the aim being to strategically influence investment policies or define preferential benchmarks.

These tools are composed by a core of nanostructured gas sensors that analyze the composition of gases produced by human organism that can be affected by volatile cancer biomarkers. Such screening methods are innovative with respect to the traditional ones with the advantage of being less invasive for the patient, efficient and economic. SCENT A1 is the first patented device (now in Italy, UK and Germany), capable of performing a non invasive colorectal cancer (CRC) preventive screening by the analysis of fecal exhalation. The clinical validation, started in May 2016, will be concluded by the end of 2019. This device will be able of improving the results of fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in the countries in which it is adopted by the national health service (e.g. Italy) and will be presented as a new preventive test on the population in those countries in which no screening methodology has yet been adopted. Thanks to this device a huge nuber of non operative colonoscopies due to FOBT false positives (more than 60%) will be avoided. The inclusion of this system will also increase the number of adhesions to screening system, due to the fear of undergoing colonoscopy. The second device, named SCENT B1 (Italian patent) is capable of performing a post-surgery monitoring on blood samples, to detect the presence of volatile tumor markers exhaled from localized neoplasms and/or from metastasis. By means of this device it is also possible to check the health status of cells, the degenerative state of a tumor tissue and efficacy of drugs, applied to bacterial cultures and neoplastic tissues.",Zonta Giulia ,Sales Executive,01-Oct,,nicolo.landini@unife.it,532974286,Lone Administrator,giulia.zonta@unife.it,532974286,Sales Executive,Landini Nicol� ,Zonta Giulia ,www.scent-srl.it,60c32780969bd70ed495b6ec

Clean Tech & Environment,Research and development,Horo s.r.l.,"Horo is development, production and commercialization of an innovative active noise cancelling devices kit.
 Kit is composed by modules, which installed out of a window reduce incoming noise with both OPEN and CLOSED window.
 Horo works using ANC (active noise cancelling) technology trough three steps:
 1) listenign: thanks to little microphones Horo listen external noise, in particular it's phase.
 
 2) anti-noise creation: with ANC algorithm, modules take noise's phase and create its opposite
 
 3) noise reduction: speaker re-play first sound with this new phase, reducing original noise.
 
 modules are wired to home. In our ideal scenario modules works with solar powered batteries.
 
 No one in the market is provinding our user centered solutions.
 Sound blocking solutions are divided in two areas, passive and active solutions. passive solutions like foam layers, double glasses ecc are better for high frequences noise (high noise peaks, ecc). Instead, active solutions using ANC technology, are better for low frequency noises like traffic, voices, middle background noise and all noises created by a periodic element in movement (like engine, fan ecc).
 Already existing active solutions are working with closed window.
 No one is providing this open window benefit, ensuring a total domestic experience thanks to this running function.
 Horo is just composed just by hardware components in a simple
 parallelepiped case, being in this way also visually ""invisible"". 
 Horo is a modular kit, compatible with any kind of window (small, medium or big, glass window, doors ecc) it's just matter of place and install this modules wherever we want and let this invisible shield work. it could be applied in different scenarios:
 private & public spaces, hospitals, eco & zen-building, yacht and sail boats, offices, museums, coworking spaces and libraries...wherever silence could be necessary.", Urso Guglielmo,Sole Director,43374,Smart Cities & Communities,g.urso.design@gmail.com,3470813567,Sole Director & Designer,,,, Urso Guglielmo,,www.horoproject.com,60c32780969bd70ed495b705

To shorten the supply chain and connect growers with Point of Sales (POSs) in Europe we integrated our B2B trading platform with a Cloud-based ERP software tool for the firm�s management highly customized depending on growers� specific needs and requirement. The ERP software includes modular functionalities for the remote control of RFID tags, Greenhouse Sensors and allows growers to generate a wide array of GS1 Encryption Codes for the handling of products inside and outside the firm boundaries.   
In this way, product and production data valuable from a market point of view are processed, stored and made available in our VirtualHub that works as a 360� management tool for growers and as a trading platform for high-quality agricultural products accessible by POSs. 
We applied principles of aggregate sales and inventory planning proven to be successful in business cases such as �Amazon� and �Walmart� and not yet fully exploited for the perishable goods supply chain management in the European scenario. The underlying idea is that, by converting real-life production and logistical aspects onto numerical variables that can be optimized using simple AI algorithms and other multi-linear programming tools, we can optimize growers� operation not individually but as a whole.
